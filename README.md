## Overview Headline
**Enhancing Organizational Awareness and Risk Management Through Data-Driven Insights**

## Overview
This project focused on analyzing employee perceptions of risk awareness, ethical tolerance, engagement, and employment stability within an organization. Leveraging survey data, the study aimed to uncover key patterns and insights that could guide strategic initiatives in organizational development, risk management, and employee engagement. The findings informed actionable recommendations for improving risk-related communication, ethical policy enforcement, and engagement strategies.

## Data Details
The project utilized data from a 50-respondent survey contained in the appendix of a practical evaluation document. Key variables included awareness of organizational risk levels, risk appetite, ethical behavior tolerance, engagement levels, and employment agreements. Each question provided frequency distributions, percentage breakdowns, and cumulative metrics.

## Problem Statement
The organization needed to understand employees' perceptions of critical areas, such as risk awareness, ethical tolerance, and engagement, to strengthen its policies, procedures, and culture. This included addressing gaps in communication and enhancing organizational alignment with employee perspectives.

## Solution
The analysis involved:
- Tabulating survey data.
- Visualizing each question’s results using appropriate graphs.
- Interpreting key trends and patterns in employee responses.
- Providing actionable insights to address identified gaps and opportunities for improvement.

## Insights
- **Risk Awareness:** 76% of employees reported high or very high awareness of risk levels, indicating strong organizational communication but room for improvement among the remaining 24%.
- **Risk Appetite:** 38% described the entity’s risk appetite as moderate, with 26% unsure, highlighting a need for clearer communication on risk strategy.
- **Ethical Tolerance:** 78% considered unethical behavior highly or very highly intolerable, underscoring a positive ethical culture but revealing a need for reinforcement in 8% of respondents.
- **Engagement Levels:** 84% reported high or very high engagement, reflecting strong organizational commitment but opportunities for engagement optimization.
- **Employment Stability:** 92% were permanent employees, reflecting stability but requiring tailored strategies for the minority contracted employees.

## Recommendation
- **Risk Management:** Increase training and communication on organizational risk strategies to enhance clarity and understanding among employees.
- **Ethics Policy Enforcement:** Strengthen ethical training programs and emphasize a zero-tolerance policy through consistent messaging and clear consequences for violations.
- **Employee Engagement:** Develop targeted initiatives to further enhance engagement levels, focusing on respondents in the moderate category.
- **Diversity in Employment Agreements:** Design initiatives that cater to both permanent and contract employees to optimize satisfaction and retention across groups.
